    <h1><b>My school</b></h1>
<P>My school is called <highlight>Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan</highlight>, Wayanad Kendra. There are<br>
    many Bharatiya Vidya Bhavans across India. It was founded on 7 November 1938 by K. M Munshi,<br>
    with the support of Mahatma Gandhi but the branch where I study was founded in 1993. My school<br>
    has an enrollment of about 1000 pupil and is one of the few CBSE curriculum schools which provide<br>
    higher secondary education in Wayanad district. It offers language courses in Malayalam, Hindi,<br>
    and even Sanskrit. Commerce, Biology and Computer streams are available for upper classes.</p><br>
    <p>My school has all modern facilities like a library, Computer lab, Biology lab, Physics lab,<br>
        Chemistry lab and even an Audio Vision (AV) room. This year, the administration has even put<br>
        a Digital touchscreen board in one of the classrooms. My school has a large ground, perfect <br>
        for playing sports. The campus has a residential neighbourhood on one side and a forest on the<br>
        other side.</p>
